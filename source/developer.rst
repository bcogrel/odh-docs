...harvest data exposed by the dataset.
   Browse the list of :ref:`available_datasets` to see what types of
   data are contained in the datasets, and think how they can be used.

   For this purpose, we maintain an updated list of the
   :ref:`available datasets <available_datasets>` with links to the
   API to access them.


...build a application with the data.
   Write code for an app that combines the data you can harvest from
   the available datasets in various, novel way.

   To reach this goal, you need to access the APIs, their
   documentation, and the datasets. It is then your task to discover
   how you can reuse the data in your code.

...publish your app in |odh|\.
   As soon as you have developed a stable version of your app, get in
   touch with us: We plan to maintain an updated list of apps based on
   our dataset included with this documentation.


No software installation is needed: Go to the list of apps (not yet
available, be the first!) or API documentation/datasets and start from
there.
