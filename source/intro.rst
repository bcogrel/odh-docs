 Introduction
==============

This is the website of the |ODH| documentation, a collection of
technical resources about the |odh| project. The website serves as the
main resource portal for everyone interested in accessing the data or
deploying apps based on :term:`datasets <dataset>` & :term:`API`\s
provided by the |odh| team.

The technical stuff is composed of:

* Catalogue of available datasets.
* How-tos, FAQs, and various tips and tricks for users.
* Links to the full API documentation.
* Resources for developers.

Project Overview
================

The |odh| project envisions the development and set up of a portal
whose primary purpose is to offer a single access point to all (Open)
Data from the region of South Tyrol, Italy, that are relevant for the
economy sector and its actors. This will also allow everybody to
utilise these data in all digital communication channels and build
application on top of the data offered, be them either a :abbr:`PoC
(Proof of Concept)` to explore new means or new field in which to use
|odh| data, or novel and innovative services or software products
built on top of the data.

   An overview of the |odh| Project.

All the data within the |odh| will be easily accessible, preferring
open interfaces and APIs which are built on existing standards like
`The Open Travel Alliance <https://opentravel.org/>`_ (OTA), `The
General Transit Feed Specification <https://gtfs.org/>`_ (GTFS),
`Alpinebits <https://www.alpinebits.org/>`_.

The |odh| team also strives to keep all data regularly updated, and
use standard exchange formats for them like `Json
<http://www.json.org/>`_ and the `Data Catalog Vocabulary
<https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/>`_ (DCAT).

Depending on the development of the project and the interest of users,
more standards and data formats might be supported in the future.
