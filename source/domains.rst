The domains intended as sources for data served by the |odh| are
depicted in :numref:`domains-diagram`.
 
The :strong:`API` of a software contains the definition of methods and of
their signatures, that can be invoked to retrieve data from the web
services provided by the software itself. The signature of each method
defines how to invoke the method (i.e., the name of the method), which
parameters should be supplied (i.e., their names and types, if they
are mandatory or not, and what the method returns (i.e., the type and
format of the output produced by the method. By using an API, it is
possible to receive data from the web service and process them.

Currently, the following :term:`APIs <API>` are available from the
|odh|\:

#. :strong:`Mobility APIs`
#. :strong:`SASAbus APIs`
#. :strong:`Tourism APIs`.

The first and second APIs provide datasets that belong to the
`Mobility Domain`, while the third one to datasets in the `Tourism
Domain`.

The Mobility APIs allow to access real-time data of the datasets
concerning the e-mobility, including data about e-charging stations,
availability of plugs to recharge e-cars, and so on.

The SASAbus APIs are part of the Mobility domain and allow to access
various type of data about buses and station.

The Tourism API allows to access locations (of hotels,
museums, events, and so on), points of interests, and a number of
other information about the tourism in South Tyrol.
