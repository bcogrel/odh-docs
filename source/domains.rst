A :term:`domain` is a category that contains entities that are closely
related. In the |odh|, each domain roughly identifies one social or
economical category; the domains intended as sources for data served
by the |odh| are depicted at the bottom of :numref:`domains-diagram`.

Currently, the domains that can be accessed through the |odh| are:

#. :strong:`Mobility`: this domain contains data about public transportation,
   parkings, charging station, and so on.
#. :strong:`Tourism`: data about events, accomodations, points of interest, and
   so on.

Each domain is composed by datasets, each of which contains data
that provide useful information for the domain.

.. note:: There may be no clear separation between two domains,
   because for example, data about public transportation belong to the
   Mobility domain, but are also useful for the Tourism domain.
