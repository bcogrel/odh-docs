...help shape the future of |odh|\.
   Participate in the development of |odh|\ : Build new data
   collectors, extend the functionality of the broker, integrate new
   datasets on the existing infrastructure, develop new stable API
   versions.   

   
To be able to become a core hacker, however, requires a few additional
tasks to be carried out:


#. Learn how to successfully integrate your code with the existing
   code-base and how to interact with the |odh| team.

   In other words, you need to read and accept the
   :ref:`devel-guidelines`, summarised there and available in two
   separate parts: :doc:`guidelines/platform` and
   :doc:`guidelines/database`.

#. Install the necessary software on your local workstation (be it a
   physical workstation, a virtual machine, or a Docker instance),
   including PostgreSQL with postgis extension, JDK, git.
#. Set up all the services needed (database, application server, and
   so on).
#. Clone our git repositories.
   
   To successfully complete these tasks, please read the
   :ref:`development` tutorial, which guides you stepwise through all
   the required set up and configuration, along with some
   troubleshooting advice.

#. Coding.

   That's the funniest part, enjoy!
