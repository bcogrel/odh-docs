...provide Open Data to the Open Data Hub project.
   Share with an Open Data Licence (like e.g., |cc0| or |bysa|) the
   data you own, that can prove interesting for the Open Data Hub, for
   example because they complement existing data in the Open Data Hub or they
   pertain to an area which is not yet covered. Let your Open Data be
   freely used by App Developers in their applications.

.. note:: A :ref:`Data Provider <data-providers>` is an entity (be it
   a private company, a public institution, or a citizen) that gathers
   data on a regular basis from various sensors or devices and stores
   them in some kind of machine-readable format.
