...provide Open Data to the |odh| project.
   Share with an Open Data Licence (like e.g., |cc0| or |bysa|) the
   data you own, that can prove interesting for the |odh|\, for
   example because they complement existing data in the |odh| or they
   pertain to an area which is not yet covered. Let your Open Data be
   freely used by App Developers in their applications.

.. note:: A :ref:`Data Provider <data-providers>` is an entity (be it
   a private company, a public institution, or a citizen) that gathers
   data on a regular basis from various sensors or devices and stores
   them in some kind of machine-readable format.
