The AlpineBits Alliance strives to develop and to spread a standard
format to exchange tourism data. There are two datasets they developed
and keep up to date, that are of particular interest for |odh| users:
HotelData and DestinationData


The :strong:`AlpineBits HotelData` dataset (see
https://www.alpinebits.org/hoteldata/) is meant for data strictly
related to hotels and booking, like Inventory Basic, Inventory
HotelInfo, and FreeRooms. This dataset can be access from the
dedicated endpoint at https://alpinebits.opendatahub.bz.it/AlpineBits

.. seealso:: The dedicated howto :ref:`ab-howto`

The :strong:`AlpineBits DestinationData` dataset (see
https://www.alpinebits.org/destinationdata/) is meant to gather data
about Events and mountain-related information that can be used to find
activities during a stay in a hotel.  This dataset can be access from
the dedicated Endpoint at
https://destinationdata.alpinebits.opendatahub.bz.it
