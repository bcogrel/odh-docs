How To Contribute
=================

There are different possibilities to participate in the |odh| Project,
including -but not limited to- to report bugs in the API or errors in
the API output, to ask for more datasets to be added to our
repository, to make feature requests or suggestions for improvement.

Depending on your interest on the |odh| Project, we welcome your
participation to the project in one of the roles that we have
envisioned:

I am a user
-----------

As a :strong:`user`, you are most probably not interested in the
internals of the project or in the methods exposed by the API, but in
using apps that use data exposed by the |odh|\.

You can also browse the list of :ref:`available_datasets`, choose a
dataset and start gathering data from it, by using the documentation
provided in this site.

More details on how you can interact as a user with |odh| are in the
:ref:`contrib-user` page.

I am an App Developer
---------------------

As an :strong:`App developer`, your interest in the project is to
build your own application on top of the existing API and code and
process the data gathered from the datasets we provide.

More details on how you can interact as a developer with |odh| are in the
:ref:`contrib-developer` page.

I am a |odh| Core Hacker
------------------------

As a :strong:`Core Hacker`, you can actively participate in the
development of |bdp| Core to write your own data collectors to
interact with datasets that are not yet part of |odh|.

More details on how you can help shaping the future of |odh| are in
the :ref:`corehacker` page.
