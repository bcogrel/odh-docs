How To Contribute
=================

There are different possibilities to participate in the |odh| Project,
including -but not limited to- to report bugs in the API or errors in
the API output, to ask for more datasets to be added to our
repository, to make feature requests or suggestions for improvement.

Depending on your interest on the |odh| Project, we welcome your
participation to the project in one of the roles that we have
envisioned: :ref:`User <user>`, :ref:`App developer <app-developer>`,
:ref:`Core Hacker <core-hacker>`.

You can also help the |odh| project grow and improve by
:ref:`reporting bugs or asking new features <bug-reports>`.
