Guidelines for Developers
=========================

This part describes the coding conventions to which a developer must
adhere, to be able to become an active |odh| developer. They are split
in two parts:

* :doc:`platform` explain the preferred programming languages, how to
  expose the data after you manipulated them, the use of third-party
  libraries or plugins, and so on.
* :doc:`database` clarify how to design a database that shall become
  part of the |odh| platform.
