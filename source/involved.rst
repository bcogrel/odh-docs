   Relations between the actors involved in the |odh|\.

There are different possibilities to participate in the Open Data Hub
Project, including -but not limited to- to report bugs in the API or
errors in the API output, to ask for more datasets to be added to our
repository, to make feature requests or suggestions for improvement,
and even to participate in the development or supply new data to be
shared.

:numref:`odh-actors` shows at a glance the various roles that
potential users can play within the |odh|\, according to their
interest, expertise, skills, and knowledge.

Depending on your interest on the Open Data Hub Project, we welcome
your participation to the project in one of the roles that we have
envisioned: :strong:`User`, :strong:`App developer`, :strong:`Core
Hacker`, and :strong:`Data Provider`. Below you can find out a list of
tasks that belong to each of these roles; we believe that this list
can help you understand which type of contribution you can give to the
|odh| project!

Besides the tasks that you find below, you can also help the Open Data
Hub project grow and improve by reporting bugs or asking for new
features, following the directions presented in  :ref:`the dedicated
section below <bug-reports>`.
