.. traffic station


This datasets contains two types of data, both collected by sensors
along the Italian A22 motorway.

#. Aggregated data recorded by sensors drowned in asphalt, but
   separated for each lane of a street. For people in Italy, these
   sensors are those large rectangle boxes engraved in asphalt that
   you can seen also on streets in the cities.

#. The VMS (Variable Message Sign) sensors collect data about the
   electronic road signs on the Motorway.
