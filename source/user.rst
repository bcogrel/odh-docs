As a user I can...
==================

...install and use an app built on top of the API.
   Browse the list of available applications developed by
   third-parties, choose one that you are interested in, install it
   and try it out, then send feedback to their developers if you feel
   something is wrong or missing.

   While we plan to keep an up-to-date list of those applications, as of
   |today|, no such application that we are aware of has been released.

...explore the data in the datasets.
   Choose a dataset from the list of :ref:`available_datasets` and
   start gathering data from it, by using the documentation provided
   in this site. You can then provide any kind of feedback on the
   dataset: reports about any malfunctions, suggestions for
   improvements or new features, and so on.

   Moreover, if you are interested in datasets that are not yet in our
   collection, get in touch with the |odh| team to discuss your
   request.

No software installation is needed: Go to the list of apps (not yet
available) or the list of datasets and start from there.
