Apps built from |ODH| datasets
==============================

This section features a list of applications, and some additional
useful information about them, built using the :doc:`datasets` that
the |odh| team makes available.

The additional information may include the home page of the app, the
contact address of the developers, a description, and the type of the
application (mobile app, web page, and so on)..

However, the most important attribute of each project is probably its
:strong:`status`, which might be one of these three:

* Experimental status, aka `alpha stage`, shown by the |alpha|
  badge. Applications falling in this category are in the early stage
  of development, and might be for example, a proof of concept or the
  outcome of a hackathon. They might not be maintained or developed
  further and should not be considered mature enough to be deployed in
  a production environment.
* Development status, aka `beta stage`, shown by the |beta|
  badge. Application in beta stage are developed actively and might
  already be suitable for a production environment.
* Production status. These applications are already used in production
  environment.  

If you are developing one application with the data provided by
datasets of the |odh| project, send an email with a short description,
an email contact and its status and we'll add it to the list.


Alpha Stage Apps
----------------

All the projects listed in this section have been built during various
hackathons and must be considered as `Experimental`. |alpha|

Beta Stage Apps
---------------

* http://mobility.meran.eu. This web site is the first example of a
  Mobility-as-a-Service application; it includes real-time information
  of multiple mobility services, like public transportation, places of
  interests, car sharing services, parking lots, ans more.

* https://parking.bz.it. A web site that displays the real-tim parking
  availability of off-street parking lots in South Tyrol. On mobile
  devices, it can also show directions from your current position to
  the chosen parking lot.

* http://traffic.bz.it. Some streets in South Tyrol are monitored for
  real-time vehicular travel times; the data collected are used by
  this web site to show traffic slowdowns or jams.
  
* http://bus.bz.it. This web site shows the real-time positions of the
  buses managed by the public transport operator SASA. Urban or
  suburban bus lines can be shown, and for each bus can be shown the
  next few stops and an estimate of the arrival time.

* http://map.clean-roads.eu. One of the CLEAN-ROADS project outcomes,
  this web site shows real-time data of the meteorological stations
  that are situated along public streets.
  

Production Stage
----------------

* http://www.sudtirol.info. This website uses data from the
  :ref:`tourism-datasets` to display events in the region of South
  Tyrol and other useful information to help tourists organise their
  holiday in South Tyrol.

* South Tyrol Guide, the official smartphone app for exploring and
  experiencing South Tyrol, available for both `Android
  <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suedtirol.android>`_
