Apps built from |ODH| datasets
==============================

This section features a list of applications, and some additional
useful information about them, built using the :doc:`datasets` that
the |odh| team makes available.

The additional information may include the home page of the app, the
contact address of the developers, a description, and the type of the
application (mobile app, web page, and so on)..

However, the most important attribute of each project is probably its
:strong:`status`, which might be one of these three:

* Experimental status, aka `alpha stage`, shown by the |alpha|
  badge. Applications falling in this category are in the early stage
  of development, and might be for example, a proof of concept or the
  outcome of a hackathon. They might not be maintained or developed
  further and should not be considered mature enough to be deployed in
  a production environment.
* Development status, aka `beta stage`, shown by the |beta|
  badge. Application in beta stage are developed actively and might
  already be suitable for a production environment.
* Production status. These applications are already used in production
  environment.  

If you are developing one application with the data provided within
the |odh| project, send an email with a short description, an email
contact and its status: we'll add it to the list.
